The Linux_Application_TTY for MCIMX7D boards is an example of communication between the
Cortex-A and the Cortex-M using the OpenAMP stack as provided by NXP.

On the Cortex-A the imx_rpmsg_tty module has to be loaded to the
Linux kernel. Its source code is available in the GIT repository:
http://git.freescale.com/git/cgit.cgi/imx/linux-2.6-imx.git

Its counterpart is the RPMSG_TTY_RTX_M4. The Linux application sends 
a message "Hello from A7" and the TTY RTX application answers with 
the message "Hello from M4".

The RPMSG_TTY_CMSIS-RTOS2_M4 application for the MCIMX7D-SABRE and IMX7-PHYBOARD-ZETA boards
is an example of communication between the Cortex-A and the Cortex-M using the 
OpenAMP stack as provided by NXP.

This project is based on the NXP FreeRTOS-BSP for Cortex-M4:

On the Cortex-A the imx_rpmsg_tty module has to be loaded to the
Linux kernel. Its source code is available in the GIT repository:
http://git.freescale.com/git/cgit.cgi/imx/linux-2.6-imx.git

Its counterpart is the Linux_Application_TTY. The Linux application sends 
a message "Hello from A7" and the RPMSG_TTY_CMSIS-RTOS2_M4 application answers with
the message "Hello from M4".
